These are my exercises in python from the course "Introduction to Computer Science with Python Part 1" available on coursera.com and designed at IME-USP by professor Fabio Kon, it was the first time I saw python, it's a fun type of code for learn, as it is easier to build and layout your code, but I only saw the beginning of this type of language, so everything you will see here is very basic, except for some final exercises where I needed some extra help.
